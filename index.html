                    The factors influencing performance and success in NBA teams are multifaceted, blending individual
                    player metrics with overall team dynamics. This complexity makes it a fascinating area for data
                    science research. By analyzing how variables like points scored, playing time, assists, and rebounds
                    contribute to both player and team success, we can uncover valuable insights into strategies that
                    drive championship victories. This research goes beyond identifying standout players—it explores how
                    their performances align with team outcomes, shedding light on the key differentiators of
                    championship-winning teams. Through the analysis of historical data and visualization of trends and
                    correlations, this study aims to identify patterns that can provide valuable lessons for coaches,
                    analysts, and basketball enthusiasts alike. Ultimately, this research will deepen our understanding
                    of what drives success in professional basketball, offering strategic insights for future decisions
                    in team building and game planning.

            <div class="card">
                <p>
                    The data we are using is the NBA playoff data. The data source is reliable because all data are
                    collected from the official website, which brings up credibility. It doesn’t contain any player's
                    personal information like contact and address therefore, it doesn’t violate the privacy problem.
                    This data represents the player’s performance in different playoffs with all their stats. The data
                    has 2,576 rows with 30 columns. Most columns are made up of different statistics, which are valuable
                    in evaluating a player’s performance. Metrics like field goals made and offensive rebounds allow us
                    to analyze a player’s abilities from multiple perspectives. In addition, we also have the year of
                    the playoff season, team, and player, as well as a rank we can use to analyze this data. This data
                    is sourced from Kaggle and represents NBA data in the past decade. The following will be a link to
                    the dataset and column information.

                    Championship Data
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The data is used as a sub-dataset, which is collected from Statista. The data source is most
                    up-to-date and from the NBA’s official website, which brings up the credibility of the data
                    accuracy. It doesn’t contain any player’s personal information like contact and address therefore,
                    it doesn’t violate the privacy problem. The data contains three columns and 22 rows, and it is in
                    csv format. The championship data includes information about the championship that each team has
                    won, the home city of each team, and the team that won the championship. We plan to make a map to
                    visualize the championship for each team better.

                    government-authorized sources, and this has made the data reliable. Instead of in the file, the data
                    is in CSV, and it is in the format of longitude and latitude, which can help locate the most
                    accurate location for each team's home city.
