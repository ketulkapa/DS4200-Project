            How to Interact with the Map
        </h3>
            <p class="card">
                We created an interactive map to visualize the championship status for each team across various cities
                in
                the United States. For each city, we set the mark to a circle, and it is an interactive feature. By
                clicking
                on the marker, a pop-up will display detailed information about the city, team name, and the exact
                number of
                championships that the team has won. The markers are color-coded and have different sizes to show
                different
                championship counts. This feature will provide a quick visual reference for the audience before
                selecting
                any marks they are interested in. Additionally, the map could be zoomed in or out using the control
                button
                or by scrolling. This feature helps the audience to better explore a specific region or view the map
                from a
                broader perspective.

                Analysis of the NBA Championships Interactive Map
            </h3>
            <p class="card">
                The NBA Championships Interactive map shows a big picture of the geographic distribution of
                championships
                between 1964 and 2024. Major cities such as Boston and Los Angeles lead the map with the most
                championships,
                showing the historical success of teams like the Celtics and Lakers. This observation shows the team
                that
                has won more titles is likely to have strong management, consistent player development, and market size
                that
                may have contributed to their success in these teams. Meanwhile, some teams, such as Phoenix and
                Brooklyn,
                havenâ€™t won a championship yet, showing a situation of disparities in team performance over time. This
                map
                provides valuable historical evidence of the competitive landscape for each team in the NBA history.
                In the future, we could enhance this analysis to show more in-depth features with the map to bring a
                better
                landscape to the audience. We could do this by incorporating additional data such as team performance
                trends, player contribution, or economic impact on the cities. We can add more interactive features like
                time-lapse to display how championship distribution has evolved over the years to provide a more
                in-depth
                insight into shifts in team dynamics. Lastly, we could integrate predictive analysis to help identify
                teams
                that likely to win future championships based on historical and current performance metrics.
