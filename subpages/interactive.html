                How to Interact with the Map
            </h3>
            <p class="card">
                We created an interactive map to visualize the championship status for each team across various cities
                in the United States. For each city, we set the mark to a circle, and it is an interactive feature. By
                clicking on the mark (circle), a pop-up text will display detailed information about the city, team
                name, and the exact number of championships that the team has won. The markers are color-coded and have
                different sizes to show different championship counts. This feature will provide a quick visual
                reference for the audience before selecting any marks they are interested in. Additionally, the map
                could be zoomed in or out using the control button or by scrolling. This feature helps the audience to
                better explore a specific region or view the map from a broader perspective.

                Analysis of the NBA Championships Interactive Map
            </h3>
            <p class="card">
                The NBA Championships Interactive map shows a big picture of the geographic distribution of
                championships between 1964 and 2024. Major cities such as Boston and Los Angeles lead the map with the
                most championships, showing the historical success of teams like the Celtics and Lakers. This
                observation shows the team that has won more titles is likely to have strong management, consistent
                player development, and market size that may have contributed to their success in these teams.
                Meanwhile, some teams, such as Phoenix and Brooklyn, havenâ€™t won a championship yet, showing a situation
                of disparities in team performance over time. This map provides valuable historical evidence of the
                competitive landscape for each team in the NBA history.
                In the future, we could enhance this analysis to show more in-depth features with the map to bring a
                better landscape to the audience. We could do this by incorporating additional data such as team
                performance trends, player contribution, or economic impact on the cities. We can add more interactive
                features like time-lapse to display how championship distribution has evolved over the years to provide
                a more in-depth insight into shifts in team dynamics. Lastly, we could integrate predictive analysis to
                help identify teams that likely to win future championships based on historical and current performance
                metrics.

                How to Interact with the Plot
            </h3>
            <p class="card">
                This interactive scatter plot shows points scored (PTS) by each NBA player along with number of assists
                (AST) and rebounds (REB) across seasons from 2012-13 to 2023-24. Each. player will have three different
                markers, representing each metric in detail. This plot can be interacted with by clicking on the name of
                the desired player through the legend, which isolates data for that specific player and removes the
                other players from the graph. This allows focused analysis of one player's performance against others
                across seasons. Moreover, users can click their names to add multiple players back onto the graph to
                compare player performances. This interaction helps analyze any trends or performance differences
                between players over various seasons.
            <h3>
                Analysis of the Player Performance Comparison Interactive Plot
            </h3>
            <p class="card">
                The interactive plot allows us to see the key insights into player performance trends and their
                contributions to team success. The individual strengths are shown as a dispersion among the metrics,
                which shows the difference in the roles of players. A player like LeBron James may come off as one of
                the best in all three features which are PTS, AST, REB consistently. However, other players, for
                example, Kevin Durant, might just be one of the top players in scoring but the plot shows how he may
                comparatively have less assists or rebounds. In addition, it shows seasonal patterns, such as decreases
                consistency, or peak years, which can be useful in tracking how players change over time. In this way,
                people can evaluate a player's long-term value to their team or compare exceptional seasons. The plot
                also emphasizes how teams strategically depend on certain players for specific functions, such as
                rebounding, assisting, or scoring. If a player is balanced and has contributions to all three metrics,
                it could suggest a player's more diversified role on the team. However, if a player has consistent high
                scoring, it could suggest that he is the team's anchor, based around his offence. For analysts, coaches,
                and fans, the analysis that follows links these specific performances to more comprehensive strategies
                and achievements.

                3-Point vs. 2-Point Shooting Evolution in the Playoffs

            <p class="card">
                Some key observation our team found is the three point attempts and makes shows an increasing trend from
                2012-2024 with 3 point made per game increasing by 68% over the past 12 years from 0.68 to 1.14. This
                finding shows that the team has shifted scoring strategies and is focusing more on making 3's. This is
                an evolutionary change because effectively making 3's can help the team score more points compared to
                the team still focusing on 2 point strategies. Conversely, 2-point attempts show a downward trend over
                this period due to 3-point strategies. Overall, this visualization reflects the NBA's 3-point revolution
                even in the playoff season, where players usually choose to shoot more 2 points (safer way to score).
                Players and teams are now using strategies that prioritize 3-point shots while maintaining consistent
                efficiency in 2-point shooting (2-point made per game has not significantly changed in the past 12
                seasons).
