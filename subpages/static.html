            </h2>

                This chart shows the 30 players that have the most playoff minutes. It shows Lebron leading by a
                substantial amount. This makes sense because Lebron played for many championship teams, which increases
                his minutes. Lebron is also a star player and arguably one of the best players to ever play the game.
                Players like Draymond Green, Durant, Kawhi and Stephen Curry have high playoff minutes, which is a
                reflection of their experience and the success of their teams. Winning more playoff games, gives them
                more chances to play and increase their playing time. These players have lots of experience in the
                playoffs and have deep runs and often reach the finals. This chart has young players who are on the rise
                and are gaining more playoff experience. An example is Jayson Tatum. Although he is relatively young, he
                plays a key role in the Celtic's playoff success and is trusted with heavy playoff minutes

                This bar chart displays the assist-to-turnover ratio of the top 20 highest-scoring players, showcasing
                how effectively they manage ball distribution relative to turnovers. Chris Paul leads significantly with
                the highest assist-to-turnover ratio, emphasizing his exceptional playmaking and efficiency in ball
                handling. Al Horford, Jimmy Butler, and Kyle Lowry also stand out with strong ratios, highlighting their
                ability to maintain possession and create opportunities. On the other end, players like Jaylen Brown and
                Klay Thompson rank lower, indicating a focus on scoring rather than playmaking or higher turnover rates
                relative to their assists. Overall, the chart illustrates varying playmaking efficiencies among these
                top scorers, with notable differences in their roles and styles of play.

                3-Point Field Goals per Game - Latest Playoff Season
            </h2>
            <embed type="text/html" src="../Static Plots Code/3pt.html" width="1000" height="750" class="card">

                This chart shows the players who made the most 3-point field goals per game in the latest playoffs.
                It depicts newer talents and veteran players. Players like Curry, Harden, and Lillard stand out because
                of their reputations as sharp 3-point shooters and their key roles for their teams. They also have more
                experience in the playoffs and more chances to take 3’s during playoff games. The chart showcases newer
                talents such as Donovan Mitchell. Although Mitchell has been in the NBA for less time compared to other
                names, he leads in the number of 3s per playoff games. In addition to showing the players who made the
                most 3’s in playoff games, the chart highlights the gap between elite shooters like Curry, who is
                renowned for his deep shooting range and high volume, and other skilled shooters who still contribute
                significantly but at a lower frequency and indicates a strategic emphasis on how 3s are shot.
