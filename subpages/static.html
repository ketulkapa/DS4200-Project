                Top 30 Players in the Playoffs with the Most Minutes Played
            </h2>

            <p class="card">
                This chart shows the 30 players that have the most playoff minutes. It shows Lebron leading by a
                substantial amount. This makes sense because Lebron played for many championship teams, which increases
                his minutes. Lebron is also a star player and arguably one of the best players to ever play the game.
                Players like Draymond Green, Durant, Kawhi and Stephen Curry have high playoff minutes, which is a
                reflection of their experience and the success of their teams. Winning more playoff games, gives them
                more chances to play and increase their playing time. These players have lots of experience in the
                playoffs and have deep runs and often reach the finals. This chart has young players who are on the rise
                and are gaining more playoff experience. An example is Jayson Tatum. Although he is relatively young, he
                plays a key role in the Celtic's playoff success and is trusted with heavy playoff minutes

                Assist to Turnover Ratio and NBA Championships
            </h2>
            <img src="../charts/assist to turnover team.png" width="1000" height="600" class="card">
            <p class="card">
                The chart illustrates the relationship between NBA teams' Assist to Turnover Ratios (ATR) and their
                historical championship wins. The Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers lead with 18 and 17
                championships, respectively, despite having moderate ATRs, showing that factors beyond ATR contribute
                significantly to success. Teams like the Timberwolves, Suns, and Clippers have high ATRs but no
                championships, indicating that efficiency in assists relative to turnovers alone does not guarantee
                titles. On the other hand, teams like the Bulls (6 championships) and Warriors (7 championships) have
                found success with balanced ATRs, reflecting a broader strategic approach. The chart highlights that
                while a strong ATR can signal effective teamwork and ball handling, it is only one component of the
                complex formula for achieving championships in the NBA.

                3-Point Field Goals per Game - Latest Playoff Season
            </h2>
            <embed type="text/html" src="../Static Plots Code/3pt.html" width="1000" height="750" class="card">
            <p class="card">
                This chart shows the players who made the most 3-point field goals per game in the latest playoffs.
                It depicts newer talents and veteran players. Players like Curry, Harden, and Lillard stand out because
                of their reputations as sharp 3-point shooters and their key roles for their teams. They also have more
                experience in the playoffs and more chances to take 3’s during playoff games. The chart showcases newer
                talents such as Donovan Mitchell. Although Mitchell has been in the NBA for less time compared to other
                names, he leads in the number of 3s per playoff games. In addition to showing the players who made the
                most 3’s in playoff games, the chart highlights the gap between elite shooters like Curry, who is
                renowned for his deep shooting range and high volume, and other skilled shooters who still contribute
                significantly but at a lower frequency and indicates a strategic emphasis on how 3s are shot.
