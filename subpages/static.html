                This chart shows the players who made the most 3-point field goals per game in the latest playoffs.
                It depicts newer talents and veteran players. Players like Curry, Harden, and Lillard stand out because
                of their reputations as sharp 3-point shooters and their key roles for their teams. They also have more
                experience in the playoffs and more chances to take 3’s during playoff games. The chart showcases newer
                talents such as Donovan Mitchell. Although Mitchell has been in the NBA for less time compared to other
                names, he leads in the number of 3s per playoff games. In addition to showing the players who made the
                most 3’s in playoff games, the chart highlights the gap between elite shooters like Curry, who is
                renowned for his deep shooting range and high volume, and other skilled shooters who still contribute
                significantly but at a lower frequency and indicates a strategic emphasis on how 3s are shot.
